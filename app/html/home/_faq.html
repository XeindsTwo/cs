          Your account can be blocked. If there is a minor violation it can be banned from certain services. But if your
          account is associated with those who have major violations like scams, using crypto in Darknet, or in mixers,
          your wallet could be permanently banned. You will lose access to all money in this wallet.

          The easiest way to avoid suspicious crypto is to check every transaction. Or use the services of a
          built-in “dirty-money checker”. But even today, very few services have a built-in checker, so it will be
          easier to check every possible transaction.
